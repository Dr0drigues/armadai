# ArmadAI Skill Authoring

Complete reference for creating and maintaining ArmadAI skills following the Agent Skills open standard.

Skills are structured knowledge packs that provide reference documentation, scripts, and assets to AI agents. Unlike prompts (composable instruction fragments), skills are self-contained directories with rich content organized by domain.

See the `references/` directory for detailed documentation:

- **format.md** — SKILL.md specification and directory structure
- **best-practices.md** — Guidelines for structuring skills effectively
- **examples.md** — Real-world skill patterns and complete examples
