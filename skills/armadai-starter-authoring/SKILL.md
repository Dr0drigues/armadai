# ArmadAI Starter Pack Authoring

Complete reference for creating and maintaining ArmadAI starter packs — curated bundles that group agents, prompts, and skills into installable packages.

Starter packs are the primary distribution unit for ArmadAI fleets. They allow users to bootstrap a fully functional agent team with a single `armadai init --pack <name>` command.

See the `references/` directory for detailed documentation:

- **format.md** — Starter pack structure, `pack.yaml` specification, and resolution order
- **best-practices.md** — Guidelines for designing cohesive, effective starter packs
- **examples.md** — Real-world patterns from existing built-in packs
